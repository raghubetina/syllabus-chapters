<p class="lead font-italic">Full-Stack Application Development for Beginners</p>

> Knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you'll be able to implement them... It's a big advantage, when you're considering an idea like putting a college facebook online, if instead of merely thinking "That's an interesting idea," you can think instead "That's an interesting idea. I'll try building an initial version tonight."

## Objectives

The new reality is that every company is a software company. Even in traditionally brick-and-mortar industries, software is performing more and more of the work. And, of course, many companies are now purely software-based.

Lacking an understanding of _how applications work_ and _how software gets built_ while working in a software-based world puts you at a disadvantage.

In this course, you will demystify these things and dispel this disadvantage. We believe the best way for you to do that is to just ship an application yourself.

To do this, you will have to become a _full-stack developer_ — someone who can take _an idea_ all the way to _a live app on the internet_.

This involves learning much more than just one language — you'll learn multiple languages (_front-end_ and _back-end_ languages), so that you can write a _whole_ application (not just one slice of it); and how to deploy it on industrial-grade cloud infrastructure; and how to instrument it with analytics so that you can gather feedback and iterate.

Our objective, though, is not to learn any particular language or cloud platform or analytics tool. Instead, we want to:

 1. Understand how most modern software functions.
 2. Communicate more credibly with developers on our teams.
 3. Grow an eye for problems that can be solved with technology.
 4. Prioritize features more frugally by getting a better feel for their costs.
 5. Research and specify changes we want made to products more clearly.
 6. Be empowered with a new, powerful, and just plain fun creative outlet.

## Approach

This course is very _project-driven_. We will, as much as possible, learn each topic by applying it to real-world examples of increasing complexity. We will then combine topics to build more and more functional applications.

This course is also very _question-driven_. In many cases, the slides, labs, and homeworks are designed not to impart knowledge but to elicit questions; which will then prompt conversations; during which, hopefully, knowledge will be constructed[^behind_the_curtain].

[^behind_the_curtain]: If you want to look a bit further behind the curtain: we believe in [playing the whole game](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/09/01/education-bat-seven-principles-educators){:target="_blank"} and in [encountering locked doors before keys](https://mkremins.github.io/blog/doors-headaches-intellectual-need/){:target="_blank"}.

> Questions are places in your mind where answers fit. If you haven’t asked the question, the answer has nowhere to go.

This means that _**your primary responsibility is to always be looking for questions to ask, and asking them**_. If you just passively listen or silently struggle, then this isn't going to work.

Does something seem missing or confusing? Great, you spotted it — ask a question!

## Assessments

Learning assessment and your final grade will be based on the following:

 - 40% asynchronous/self-paced/at-home/introductory material.
    - You will have videos, readings, and accompanying walkthrough projects and quizzes to complete to learn new concepts at your own pace at home.
 - 40% synchronous/collaborative/classtime/enrichment material.
    - During class meetings, we'll work together on various kinds of activities to deepen your understanding of concepts; usually in groups.
 - 20% capstone project.
    - In the last week or two, you'll devote most of your time to an individual capstone project. You will have two options for your capstone project:
        - Build and deploy a barebones Proof Of Concept (POC) of your own app idea.
        - Build a more fleshed out Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of an idea that I assign.

Most assessments will be automatic and instant — you will have a command that you can run as many times as you want that will check whether your app works correctly or not.

Since most assessments are binary and objective, there is no curve. Potentially, everyone could get an A; or, everyone could get a D. Either you make your app work the way it's supposed to or you don't; it doesn't matter what someone else does or doesn't do.

## Expectations & Time Commitment

This course is designed for a beginner who has never programmed before. It is our goal to make programming accessible to as many people as possible, and dispel the mystique that surrounds it. It's really possible, with passion and persistence, for a beginner to become productive very quickly with today's tools.

**Note:** It's _possible_, but not always _easy_. If you have never seen a line of code before, you are going to be learning a lot of new things all at once, and so should plan to spend a significant amount of time. If you already have some programming experience, you may have to spend less time initially while we learn basics; but once we get into Rails, it will likely be all new to you too. Historically, students have reported spending 5 ± 2 hours each week outside of class.

What you can expect from us in return is a lot of support. We know it's a lot, and we're here for you — plenty of one-on-one office hours every week, study halls, etc. We all will help each other on the class discussion board. There is no such thing as a dumb question; we're all beginners here, learning together.

## Required Materials

We will be using cloud-based software, so that everyone's environments are consistent and no one has to worry about dealing with e.g. installing software on work-issued laptops. 

Primarily, we'll be using a service called Gitpod for this. The regular subscription price is $30/month. [If you jump through some hoops to get the student price, it's $9/month.](https://www.gitpod.io/github-student-developer-pack/){:target="_blank"} If you use less than 100 hours/month, which should be possible if you're careful about closing your tab when you're done working, then it's free.

All other required software is free.

## Zoom

Unauthorized student recording of classroom or other academic activities (including advising sessions or office hours) is prohibited. Unauthorized recording is unethical and may also be a violation of University policy and state law. Students requesting the use of assistive technology as an accommodation should contact the instructor. Unauthorized use of classroom recordings — including distributing or posting them — is also prohibited. Under the University’s Copyright Policy, faculty own the copyright to instructional materials — including those resources created specifically for the purposes of instruction, such as syllabi, lectures and lecture notes, and presentations.  Students cannot copy, reproduce, display or distribute these materials. Students who engage in unauthorized recording, unauthorized use of a recording or unauthorized distribution of instructional materials will be referred to the appropriate University office for follow-up.
