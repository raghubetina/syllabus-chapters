<p class="lead font-italic">Full-Stack Application Development for Beginners</p>

> Knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you'll be able to implement them... It's a big advantage, when you're considering an idea like putting a college facebook online, if instead of merely thinking "That's an interesting idea," you can think instead "That's an interesting idea. I'll try building an initial version tonight."

## Objectives

The new reality is that every company is a software company. Even in traditionally brick-and-mortar industries, software is performing more and more of the work. And, of course, many companies (especially "lean startups") are purely software-based.

Lacking an understanding of _how software works_ and _how software is built_ while working in a software-based world puts you at a disadvantage.

In this course, our goal will be to develop an understanding of both of these things. We believe the best way to do that is to just ship an application yourself.

To do this, you will have to become a _full-stack developer_ — you will take _an idea_ all the way to _a live app on the internet_. This involves learning much more than just one language — you'll learn multiple languages (front-end and back-end) so that you can write a whole application (not just one slice of it), and how to deploy it on industrial-grade hosting infrastructure, and how to instrument it with analytics so that you can gather feedback and iterate.

However, our high level objectives are to:

 1. Understand the general, language-independent patterns of how applications fit together.
 2. Communicate more effectively and credibly with developers on our teams.
 3. Develop a builder's eye for problems that can be solved with technology.
 4. Prioritize features more intelligently by getting a better feel for their costs.
 5. Implement a modern software development workflow, from task management to version control to quality assurance to deployment.
 6. Be able to make and test small changes to an application yourself.
 7. Be empowered with a new, powerful, and just plain fun creative outlet.

## Format

**Note:** We're adapting to remote learning

This course is entirely project-driven. We will build a series of applications together in class. We will start with a simple idea and learn just what we need about various technologies (database architecture, hosting, deployment, Git, HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails) to make that idea real.

We will then build a slightly more complicated idea, and deepen our knowledge of each topic. And then an even more complicated idea. In this way, we will spiral across topics picking up essential, applicable knowledge; what we're not going to do are deep theoretical dives into each topic, one after the other, without ever getting to build real stuff.

The process will generally consist of the instructor demonstrating a concept in a tutorial app and then giving the class a challenge to practice it and think up questions. You are strongly encouraged to team up and work together on the challenges.
