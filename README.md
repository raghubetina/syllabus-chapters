<p class="lead font-italic">Full-Stack Application Development for Beginners</p>

> Knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you'll be able to implement them... It's a big advantage, when you're considering an idea like putting a college facebook online, if instead of merely thinking "That's an interesting idea," you can think instead "That's an interesting idea. I'll try building an initial version tonight."

## Objectives

The new reality is that every company is a software company. Even in traditionally brick-and-mortar industries, software is performing more and more of the work. And, of course, many companies are now purely software-based.

Lacking an understanding of _how applications work_ and _how software gets built_ while working in a software-based world puts you at a disadvantage.

In this course, we will dispel this disadvantage. We believe the best way to do that is to just ship an application yourself.

To do this, you will have to become a _full-stack developer_ — someone who can take _an idea_ all the way to _a live app on the internet_.

This involves learning much more than just one language — you'll learn multiple languages (front-end and back-end), so that you can write a whole application (not just one slice of it), and how to deploy it on industrial-grade cloud infrastructure, and how to instrument it with analytics so that you can gather feedback and iterate.

Our objective, ultimately, is not to learn any particular language or cloud platform. Instead, we want to:

 1. Understand how most modern software functions.
 2. Communicate more credibly with developers on our teams.
 3. Grow an eye for problems that can be solved with technology.
 4. Prioritize features more frugally by getting a better feel for their costs.
 5. Be able to research and clearly specify changes we want made to products.
 6. Be empowered with a new, powerful, and just plain fun creative outlet.

## Approach

This course is very _project-driven_. We will, as much as possible, learn each topic by applying it to real-world examples of increasing complexity. We will then combine topics to build more and more functional applications.

This course is also very _question-driven_. In many cases, the slides, labs, and homeworks are designed not to impart knowledge but to elicit questions; which will then prompt conversations; where, hopefully, knowledge will then be imparted[^behind_the_curtain].

[^behind_the_curtain]: If you want to look a bit further behind the curtain: we believe in [playing the whole game](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/09/01/education-bat-seven-principles-educators){:target="_blank"} and in [encountering locked doors before keys](https://mkremins.github.io/blog/doors-headaches-intellectual-need/){:target="_blank"}.

> Questions are places in your mind where answers fit. If you haven’t asked the question, the answer has nowhere to go.

This means that <u>your primary responsibility is to always be looking for questions to ask, and asking them</u>. If you're passively listening or silently struggling, then this isn't going to work.

Does something seem missing or confusing? Great, you spotted it — ask a question!
