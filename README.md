<p class="lead font-italic">Full-Stack Application Development for Beginners</p>

> Knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you'll be able to implement them... It's a big advantage, when you're considering an idea like putting a college facebook online, if instead of merely thinking "That's an interesting idea," you can think instead "That's an interesting idea. I'll try building an initial version tonight."

## Objectives

The new reality is that every company is a software company. Even in traditionally brick-and-mortar industries, software is performing more and more of the work. And, of course, many companies are now purely software-based.

Lacking an understanding of _how applications work_ and _how software gets built_ while working in a software-based world puts you at a disadvantage.

In this course, you will demystify these things and dispel this disadvantage. We believe the best way for you to do that is to just ship an application yourself.

To do this, you will have to become a _full-stack developer_ — someone who can take _an idea_ all the way to _a live app on the internet_.

This involves learning much more than just one language — you'll learn multiple languages (_front-end_ and _back-end_ languages), so that you can write a _whole_ application (not just one slice of it); and how to deploy it on industrial-grade cloud infrastructure; and how to instrument it with analytics so that you can gather feedback and iterate.

Our objective, though, is not to learn any particular language or cloud platform or analytics tool. Instead, we want to:

 1. Understand how most modern software functions.
 2. Communicate more credibly with developers on our teams.
 3. Grow an eye for problems that can be solved with technology.
 4. Prioritize features more frugally by getting a better feel for their costs.
 5. Research and specify changes we want made to products more clearly.
 6. Be empowered with a new, powerful, and just plain fun creative outlet.

## Approach

This course is very _project-driven_. We will, as much as possible, learn each topic by applying it to real-world examples of increasing complexity. We will then combine topics to build more and more functional applications.

This course is also very _question-driven_. In many cases, the slides, labs, and homeworks are designed not to impart knowledge but to elicit questions; which will then prompt conversations; during which, hopefully, knowledge will be constructed[^behind_the_curtain].

[^behind_the_curtain]: If you want to look a bit further behind the curtain: we believe in [playing the whole game](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/09/01/education-bat-seven-principles-educators){:target="_blank"} and in [encountering locked doors before keys](https://mkremins.github.io/blog/doors-headaches-intellectual-need/){:target="_blank"}.

> Questions are places in your mind where answers fit. If you haven’t asked the question, the answer has nowhere to go.

> — [Clayton Christensen](https://twitter.com/claychristensen/status/231411154050748416?s=20){:target="_blank"}

This means that _**your primary responsibility is to always be looking for questions to ask, and asking them**_. If you just passively listen or silently struggle, then this isn't going to work.

Does something seem missing or confusing? Great, you spotted it — ask a question!

## Assessments

Learning assessment and your final grade will be based on the following:

 - 40% asynchronous / self-paced / at-home / introductory material.
    - You will have videos, readings, and accompanying walkthrough projects and exercises to complete to learn new concepts at your own pace outside of class.
 - 40% synchronous / collaborative / classtime / enrichment material.
    - During class meetings, we'll work together on various exercises to deepen your understanding of concepts; usually in groups. Most of these exercises can be completed after class; some of them can only be done during class (if you _cannot_ attend class synchronously, e.g. because you're located in a timezone on the other side of the planet from Chicago, then contact the instructor and we'll work something out for these).
 - 20% capstone project.
    - In the last week or two, you'll devote most of your time to an individual capstone project. You will have two options for your capstone project:
        - Build and deploy a barebones Proof Of Concept (POC) of your own app idea.
        - Build a more fleshed out Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of an idea that I assign.
 - _Spring 2020: There is no midterm exam or attendance grade this quarter._

Most assessments will be automatic and instant — you will have a command that you can run that will check whether the app that you're working on works correctly or not, and it will report back a grade. You can run it as often as you like.

Since most assessments are objective and binary (it works or it doesn't work), _there is no curve_. Potentially, everyone could get an A; or, everyone could get a D. Either you make each project work the way it's supposed to, or you don't; and by the end you can ship an app; or you can't.

So don't worry if someone seems like others came in with more experience; don't compare yourself to anyone else; only compare yourself to yourself from yesterday. The course is designed for beginners; if you ask lots of questions, learn a little bit each day, and don't fall behind, then you'll be fine.

## Expectations & time commitment

This course is designed for a beginner who has never programmed before. It is our goal to make programming accessible to as many people as possible, and dispel some of the mystique that surrounds it. It's really possible, with passion and persistence, for a beginner to become productive very quickly with today's tools.

**Note:** It's _possible_, but not always _easy_. If you have never seen a line of code before, you are going to be learning a lot of new things all at once, and so should plan to spend a significant amount of time. If you already have some programming experience, you may have to spend less time initially while we learn basics; but once we get into Rails, it will likely be all new to you too. Historically, students have reported spending 5 ± 2 hours each week outside of class.

What you can expect from us in return is a lot of support. We all will help each other on Piazza, the class Q&A forum. There will be plenty of one-on-one office hours available for booking every week; and if you can't find a slot that works for you on our calendars, then post a private question on Piazza with a few times that work for you and one of us will meet with you then.

## Required materials

We will be using cloud-based software to write and run our applications entirely within our web browsers, so that everyone's environments are the same (no Windows vs Mac inconsistencies) and no one has to worry about e.g. going through their IT department to install Ruby on a work-issued laptop. Also, if your computer dies part-way through the quarter, no problem; you can borrow any old laptop or Chromebook and pick up right where you left off.

Primarily, we'll be using a service called Gitpod for this. The regular subscription price is $9/month. If you jump through some hoops to get the student discount, or if you use it for less than 50/hours per month (maybe possible if you're careful about closing it immediately whenever you're done working), then Gitpod costs $0/month.

All other required software is free. We'll provide step-by-step instructions for signing up for Gitpod and other required services during Week 1.

## Canvas

Canvas is our home base. Everything that you need can be found by starting from the course's Home Page on Canvas and looking through the links there — assignments, Piazza, office hours, class recordings, reference materials, etc.

## Zoom

Class will be held entirely remotely using Zoom.

 - You'll find a link for your section's Zoom "classroom" in Canvas, both on the Home Page and under Assignments.
 - You should attend the section that you are registered for. If for some reason you can't attend your own section, then it might be okay to attend a different section that week instead, but you should post on Piazza for instructor approval (it might affect the group exercises that we're planning).
 - Class is intended to be an interactive, question-filled conversation, so please turn on your camera. Caveat: we will (barring technical difficulties) post a recording[^unauthorized_recording] of class on Canvas in case anyone had trouble with their internet connection; so, if you don't want your image to appear in the recording, then it's okay to turn off your camera.
 
    We will be making heavy use of Zoom's Breakout Rooms for group activities. We will not be posting recordings of Breakout Rooms on Canvas, so we do expect your camera to be on in Breakout Rooms so that you can interact with your group mates.
 - In general, it's a good idea to keep your microphone muted, and use Push-To-Talk when you have something to say. Press and hold the <kbd>space</kbd> bar to unmute/talk, and then release to re-mute yourself. Like a walkie-talkie (remember those?).

    This makes it easier to pipe up with questions whenever one occurs to you, without having to fumble around with your mouse for the tiny <i class="fas fa-microphone-slash"></i> icon. Watch out, though: if you were chatting, your cursor might be in the chat still, in which case pressing and holding <kbd>space</kbd> might just type a bunch of spaces into the chat instead of unmuting you.
 - Alternatively, you can memorize the keyboard shortcut for muting/unmuting yourself: <kbd>cmd</kbd>`+`<kbd>shift</kbd>`+`<kbd>A</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>ctrl</kbd>`+`<kbd>A</kbd> (Windows). [Make it a Global Shortcut in your Zoom settings](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205683899-Hot-Keys-and-Keyboard-Shortcuts-for-Zoom){:target="_blank"} so that you can use it from everywhere, not just within Zoom.
 - Either way, with Push-To-Talk or with the unmute keyboard shortcut, please speak up often! Remember that this course is _question-driven_ and relies on you to be looking out for and asking questions.
 - However, sometimes you might not be sure if it's a good time to interrupt or maybe you want to share a link with your classmates that's not directly relevant to the lecture. In those cases, you can:
    - Use the Raise Hand button. I or the TAs will call on you at an opportune moment.
        - Please edit your Zoom profile and make sure your preferred name is in there.
    - Type into Zoom's chat. The TAs will be watching the chat and they will interrupt me and read your question/comment. So, if you're not sure, don't hesitate to type your questions or comments into the chat and let the TAs decide whether to escalate them.
 - Use Zoom's Nonverbal Feedback to let me know if e.g. things are moving too fast or too slow. Or hey, throw in a 👏/👎/👍 here and there.
   

[^unauthorized_recording]: Unauthorized student recording of classroom or other academic activities (including advising sessions or office hours) is prohibited. Unauthorized recording is unethical and may also be a violation of University policy and state law. Students requesting the use of assistive technology as an accommodation should contact the instructor. Unauthorized use of classroom recordings — including distributing or posting them — is also prohibited. Under the University’s Copyright Policy, faculty own the copyright to instructional materials — including those resources created specifically for the purposes of instruction, such as syllabi, lectures and lecture notes, and presentations.  Students cannot copy, reproduce, display or distribute these materials. Students who engage in unauthorized recording, unauthorized use of a recording or unauthorized distribution of instructional materials will be referred to the appropriate University office for follow-up.

We're all figuring this out[^social-distance] as we go along. If you have any suggestions or tips, please let us know.

[^social-distance]: _Please excuse us as we learn to social distance._

### Asynchronous material on your own

Most "lecture" will be done at your own pace outside of class time, not over Zoom. You'll have videos that you can speed up, pause, skip back, and watch as many times as you like; which is very helpful when you're learning to code. There will also be some written material where it makes sense.

The videos will all be available within Canvas under Assignments. There will be in-video questions in the videos, and they will have due dates like any other assignment. It is essential that you complete the videos before their due dates, so that you're prepared for our in-class exercises.

## Piazza

Most of our asynchronous communication with each other will occur over Piazza, a Q&A forum that you'll find in Canvas. (You should prefer Piazza over email; the instructors check Piazza much more frequently than email.)

Remember that in this course, **your primary responsibility is to always be looking for questions to ask, and asking them**. So Piazza is a crucial tool. Here are some guidelines for using it effectively:

 - You can make your questions visible to everyone, or just to instructors.
 - You can be anonymous to everyone, or anonymous to classmates only.
 - If you have a question about something, it’s almost guaranteed that someone else has the same question. You'd be doing everyone a favor by being the first one to ask it — don't be afraid of looking silly! (You can ask anonymously if you really want to.)
 - That said, please do everyone a favor and:
   - Make your question visible to everyone rather than to instructors only (be anonymous if you want to).
   - Browse the list of older questions and see whether your question has already been asked and answered.
   - Give your question a descriptive subject line, so that it’s easier to browse for.
 - Prefer Piazza over email — the instructors check Piazza much more frequently.
 - When you're working on your own, _you’re only allowed to get stuck for 15 minutes_ before asking a question on Piazza. Just type up what your stuck on in a question, post it, and then get back to struggling — don't struggle for longer than 15 minutes without at least asking the question.
 - Whatever you do, just **ask lots of questions**!

## Office hours

We are lucky to have actual developers as teaching assistants in this course, and you can book one-on-one appointments with them for individual help. You'll find links to calendars for making these appointments on the Canvas homepage. Utilize this amazing resource! Developers are expensive, in the real world.

Even if you only have one or two questions, or you're not even sure what to ask, it's okay to book a slot. We're happy to talk through anything with you.
